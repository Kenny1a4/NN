cifar10 - This is a neural network for object classification. It is trained on a dataset consisting of images of 10 classes, namely: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. For the test, you do not need to re-run the training, which will take several hours (there is already a trained model in the folder, so you only need to unzip the model file with the code file), just run the last block of the file. A gui (primitive program) will start, in which you can select a photo for the test (you can only upload 1 photo at a time and it must be one of the 10 classes described above) and see the prediction of the neural network.

comment - This is a neural network for analyzing comments or statements, for example, on various websites. Just set the text and see the prediction of the neural network (negative or positive comment). The dataset consisted of over 2 million data (200 thousand were used for training, since this is more than enough for a simple network).

project - This is a website I created with the theme of a coffee shop. The site features some types of drinks and coffee-related products. Some information about reviews, the cafe itself and contact details. It should also not break in the mobile version.
